I am a motivated Computer Science professional and combined BS/MS student at the University at Albany with a strong academic record (GPA 3.73) and hands-on experience in teaching, tutoring, and software engineering. As a Teaching Assistant and Peer Tutor, I have mentored students in programming and developed automated grading solutions that improved assessment efficiency. During my internship at OKNY, I contributed to full-stack application development, optimized legacy codebases, and enhanced user onboarding experiences. I am skilled in Python, Java, C/C++, Django, React, and database systems, and I have led impactful academic projects in robotics, AI, operating systems, and full-stack development, demonstrating my ability to innovate and apply advanced technical concepts to real-world problems.
